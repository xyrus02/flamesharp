# FlameSharp
A very simplistic fractal flame playground project for experimentation purposes. Might become bigger.

## Usage
In the repository, there is a `demo.cmd` batch file. Make sure you got .NET Core SDK installed (at least 3.1) and hit it!
You can run the CLI with the following command line switches:

  flamesharp.exe 
    [--resolution <value>] 
    [--verbosity <Normal | WarningsAndErrors | ErrorsOnly | Debug | Verbose>] 
    [--trace] 
    [--single-threading] 
    [--nologo] 
    [--confirm-exit] 
    <formula-file>

## Help?
This is experimental and I won't offer support. Sorry.
